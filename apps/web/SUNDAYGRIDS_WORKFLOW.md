# SundayGrids-Inspired User Workflow

## 🎯 Core User Journey (Based on SundayGrids)

### Step 1: Join a Solar Project (Reserve Solar)
- User signs up → Immediately goes to reserve page
- User can reserve solar capacity from available projects
- No need to link utility first (can be done later)
- Primary CTA: "Join Projects"

### Step 2: Link Power Provider (Connect)
- User links their utility/billing details
- Can be done after reserving or before
- Supports 70+ power providers across India
- Button: "Connect"

### Step 3: Offset Bills with Credits
- Pay bills through the platform
- Credits automatically applied
- Can fully offset bills or pay balance
- Credits don't expire

## 📱 Navigation Structure (SundayGrids Style)

### Unauthenticated:
- "Login" (text link)
- "Join Projects" (primary button) - Goes to signup/reserve

### Authenticated:
- "Connect" (for linking utility)
- "Dashboard" (main dashboard)
- "Login" → Changes to user menu or logout

## 🔄 Updated Flow

1. **Landing Page** → "Join Projects" CTA → Signup → Reserve Page
2. **Reserve Page** → Select project → Reserve capacity → Dashboard
3. **Dashboard** → Shows projects, savings, live production
4. **Connect Page** → Link utility provider → Can pay bills
5. **Bills Page** → Pay bills with credits

## 🎨 Key Differences from Current Implementation

1. **No explicit "onboarding" page** - Integrated into reserve/connect flow
2. **Reserve first, connect later** - More flexible
3. **"Join Projects" instead of "Get Started"** - Matches SundayGrids
4. **"Connect" button** - Separate utility linking page
5. **Dashboard shows live production** - Real-time solar data
